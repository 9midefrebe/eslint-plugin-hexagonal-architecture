- Box Blur: This effect is a quick and easy way to create a blurring effect. The Box blur changes the colour value of each pixel based on the pixels next to it in the vertical and horizontal directions. You can use this effect to create motion blur, depth of field, or soften edges.[^1^]
- Gaussian Blur: This effect softens the image, reducing the amount of noise and detail. You can use this effect to create a more realistic blurring effect than the Box Blur, or to create glow effects.[^1^]
- Radial Zoom Blur: This effect creates blurs around a centre point, simulating the look of a zooming or rotating camera. You can use a matte to isolate the area of the image from which you want the effect to radiate from. You can use this effect to create dynamic camera movements or focus effects.[^1^]
- Channel Swap: This effect lets you take the image information from one channel and use it in another channel to achieve interesting effects. You can extract the following: red, green, blue, alpha values, hue, saturation, lightness, and luminance, as well as turn the information on or off. You can use this effect to create colour variations or stylized effects.[^1^]
- Hue-Saturation: This effect lets you adjust the hue, saturation and lightness values individually or by using the HLS picker or Hue Range picker. You can achieve effects over the entire image, such as a sepia tone. Changes made to the values are additive to the final image.[^1^]
- Image-Switch: This effect lets you use multiple effects, such as Colour Override,
and choose which port will be sent to rendering if you want to apply different variations of an effect that cannot be changed over time. You then create multiple separate versions of the effect,
connect them all to the Image Switch,
and then if you want to change to a different version of
the effect at different points in your scene,
you would add a curve and animate
the port number.[^1^]
- Lens Flare: This effect simulates
the refraction caused by shining
a bright light into a camera lens.
The shape of the lens flare can be circular or hexagonal.
You can use this effect to create realistic or stylized lighting effects.[^1^]
- Turbulence: This effect generates noise over an entire image.
You can modify a drawing and break it apart.
You can use this effect to create distortion or warping effects. 8cf37b1e13
