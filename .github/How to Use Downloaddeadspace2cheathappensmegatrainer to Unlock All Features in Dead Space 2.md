A cheat trainer is a program that runs in the background while you play the game and allows you to activate various cheats with hotkeys. For example, you can get unlimited health, ammo, credits, nodes, stasis power, air, etc. You can also enable features like super speed, matrix mode, easy kills, rapid fire, etc.
 
One of the most popular cheat trainers for Dead Space 2 is the Cheat Happens Mega Trainer. This trainer has 15 options and works with the Steam version of the game. It also has a video demonstration and a cheat factor review on its website. However, to download this trainer, you need to have a premium membership on Cheat Happens, which costs $14.95 per year.
 
If you don't want to pay for a premium membership, you can try other cheat trainers that are available for free on other websites. For example, you can download a +9 trainer by KelSat or a +10 trainer by LIRW from MegaGames. These trainers have similar options as the Cheat Happens Mega Trainer and work with the retail or EADM version of the game.

Dead Space 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Dead Space, a survival horror game that was released in 2008. The first game followed Isaac Clarke, an engineer who was sent to repair the USG Ishimura, a mining ship that had gone silent after encountering a mysterious alien artifact called the Marker. The Marker had caused the ship's crew and dead bodies to mutate into horrific creatures called Necromorphs, which attacked Isaac and anyone else who survived. Isaac managed to escape the Ishimura, but not before being exposed to the Marker's influence, which caused him to hallucinate his dead girlfriend Nicole Brennan.
 
In Dead Space 2, Isaac wakes up three years later on the Sprawl, a massive space station built on the fragments of Titan, one of Saturn's moons. He has no memory of what happened to him after he left the Ishimura, and he soon discovers that he is suffering from a lethal form of dementia caused by his contact with the Marker. To make matters worse, a new outbreak of Necromorphs has begun on the Sprawl, and Isaac must once again fight for his life and sanity. Along the way, he meets allies and enemies, both human and alien, and learns more about the origin and purpose of the Markers.
 
Dead Space 2 features improved gameplay mechanics, graphics, sound, and level design compared to its predecessor. The game also introduces a multiplayer mode, where players can choose to play as either humans or Necromorphs in various scenarios based on the single-player campaign. The game received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, who praised its atmosphere, story, action, and horror elements. The game also spawned several spin-offs and tie-ins, such as a downloadable content expansion called Dead Space 2: Severed, which follows the fate of two characters from Dead Space: Extraction; a mobile game that serves as a prequel to Dead Space 2; an animated film called Dead Space: Aftermath that bridges the gap between the first and second games; and a novel called Dead Space: Martyr that explores the origin of the first Marker.
