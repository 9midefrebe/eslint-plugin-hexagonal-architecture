## Step 1: Download the Update from Adobe
 
The first step is to download the update that fixes the CPU leak issue in Dreamweaver CS6. You can find it on the Adobe website or by following this link: [https://www.adobe.com/support/dreamweaver/downloads\_updaters.html#dwcs6update](https://www.adobe.com/support/dreamweaver/downloads_updaters.html#dwcs6update).

## Step 2: Check if the Problem is Solved
 
After installing the update, you should check if the CPU leak issue is solved. To do this, open Dreamweaver CS6 and monitor your CPU usage. You can use Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor on Mac to see how much CPU Dreamweaver is using. If the CPU usage is normal (below 50%), then congratulations! You have successfully fixed the problem.

- **Related Files:** Some users have reported that disabling Related Files can reduce CPU usage in Dreamweaver CS6[^1^]. Related Files are files that are linked to or referenced by the current document, such as CSS files, JavaScript files, images, etc. To disable Related Files, go to Edit > Preferences > Site > Site Options and uncheck Enable Related Files.
- **Antivirus or Firewall Software:** Some antivirus or firewall software may interfere with Dreamweaver CS6 and cause high CPU usage[^1^]. To test this, try disabling your antivirus or firewall software temporarily and see if the CPU usage goes down. If it does, then you may need to add Dreamweaver CS6 as an exception or whitelist it in your antivirus or firewall settings.
- **Corrupted Cache:** Sometimes, Dreamweaver CS6 may create a corrupted cache file that can cause high CPU usage[^1^]. To clear the cache, go to Edit > Preferences > File Handling > Cache and click Clear Cache. You may need to restart Dreamweaver after doing this.

## Step 3: Optimize Your Dreamweaver Settings
 
Besides fixing the CPU leak issue, you can also optimize your Dreamweaver settings to improve its performance and avoid future problems. Here are some tips on how to do that:

- **Update Your Dreamweaver Regularly:** Adobe releases updates for Dreamweaver regularly that can fix bugs, improve features, and enhance security. You should always keep your Dreamweaver up to date by checking for updates from time to time. To do this, go to Help > Updates and follow the instructions.
- **Use Code View Instead of Design View:** Code View is faster and more efficient than Design View in Dreamweaver CS6. Design View can slow down your computer and cause 8cf37b1e13
