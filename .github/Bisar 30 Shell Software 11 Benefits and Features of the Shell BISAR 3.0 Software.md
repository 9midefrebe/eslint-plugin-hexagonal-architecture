# What is Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 and How to Use It?
 
Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 is a computer program developed by Shell that can calculate the stresses and deformations in pavement structures under various loading and environmental conditions. It is based on the elastic multi-layer theory and can handle up to 30 layers of different materials. Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 can also perform pavement design and analysis using Shell's methods and criteria.
 
Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 is a useful tool for pavement engineers, researchers, contractors, and consultants who want to optimize the performance and durability of their pavement projects. It can help them evaluate different design options, compare alternative materials and thicknesses, assess the effects of traffic loading and temperature variations, and predict the service life and maintenance needs of pavements.

To use Bisar 30 Shell Software 11, you need to install it on your PC and enter the license key that you can obtain from Shell. You also need to have some basic knowledge of pavement engineering and Shell's design methods. You can refer to the user manual and software documentation for more details on how to use the program and its features.
 
Once you have installed and activated Bisar 30 Shell Software 11, you can start a new project by entering the project name, description, location, date, and units. Then you can define the pavement structure by specifying the number, type, thickness, modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thermal coefficient of each layer. You can also assign different properties to each layer depending on whether it is asphalt, concrete, granular, or subgrade.
 
After defining the pavement structure, you can select the loading and environmental conditions that you want to analyze. You can choose from various types of loads such as single axle, tandem axle, tridem axle, or custom load. You can also enter the tire pressure, contact area, speed, frequency, and position of the load. For the environmental conditions, you can enter the temperature profile of each layer or use a default profile based on the location and season.
 
Once you have entered all the input data, you can run the analysis by clicking on the "Calculate" button. Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 will then compute the stresses and deformations in each layer and display them in graphical or tabular form. You can also view the results in terms of strains, deflections, curvatures, or factors of safety. You can export the results to a text file or print them for further use.
 
Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 can also perform pavement design using Shell's methods and criteria. You can select the design method from BANDS (Bitumen And Natural Drainage System), SPDM (Shell Pavement Design Method), or BISAR (Bitumen Stress Analysis Routine). You can then enter the design parameters such as traffic volume, axle configuration, load repetition factor, reliability level, design life, rutting limit, fatigue limit, or cracking limit. Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 will then calculate the optimum thickness of each layer and compare it with your input structure.
 
Bisar 30 Shell Software 11 is a powerful and versatile program that can help you design and analyze pavement structures with confidence and accuracy. It is based on decades of research and experience by Shell in pavement engineering. It is available for free download from [SHEVOLVE](https://shevolve.online/bisar-3-0-shell-software-11/), a website that provides software solutions for various engineering problems.
