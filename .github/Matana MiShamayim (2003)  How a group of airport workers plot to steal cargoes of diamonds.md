## Themes
 
One of the main themes of Matana MiShamayim is the clash between tradition and modernity, as the characters struggle to balance their Georgian heritage with their Israeli identity. The film portrays the tensions and contradictions that arise from this cultural hybridity, such as the contrast between the patriarchal values of the father and the feminist aspirations of the daughter, or the conflict between the religious beliefs of the mother and the secular lifestyle of the son. The film also explores how these differences affect the relationships within the family and with the outside world.
 
## Characters
 
The film focuses on three main characters: Simon (Moni Moshonov), the father; Dato (Lior Ashkenazi), the son; and Lili (Ronit Elkabetz), the daughter. Simon is a proud and stubborn man who runs a small bakery with his wife. He is very attached to his Georgian roots and traditions, and often clashes with his children over their choices and behaviors. He is also obsessed with finding a suitable husband for Lili, who is already in her late thirties.
 
Dato is a handsome and charismatic lawyer who works for a prestigious firm. He is successful and wealthy, but also unhappy and lonely. He has a strained relationship with his father, who disapproves of his secularism and his lack of interest in marriage. He also has a complicated love life, as he is involved with two women: Tamara (Anat Waxman), his boss's wife; and Yael (Liat Glick), a young waitress.
 
Lili is a smart and independent woman who works as a teacher. She is frustrated by her father's attempts to control her life and to find her a husband. She wants to be free to make her own decisions and to pursue her own happiness. She has a close bond with her brother Dato, who supports her and respects her choices. She also has a secret affair with Zaza (Sasson Gabai), an older married man who works as a doctor.
 
## Style
 
The film has a realistic and naturalistic style, using handheld camera work, long takes, natural lighting, and minimal music. The film also employs a lot of improvisation and dialogue overlap, creating a sense of spontaneity and authenticity. The film has a episodic structure, following the characters through various situations and events that reveal their personalities and dilemmas. The film also uses humor and irony to balance the drama and to highlight the absurdity of some situations.
 
## Reception
 
The film received critical acclaim both in Israel and abroad. It was praised for its honest and nuanced portrayal of the Georgian Jewish community in Israel, as well as for its excellent performances, especially by Moni Moshonov, Lior Ashkenazi, and Ronit Elkabetz.
