
 
When you are playing the game, you can access a special console that lets you enter cheat codes. To do this, you need to press the key that you have assigned to the console command (Keyboard::Button\_X) and then type the code that you want to use. The codes have different effects, such as adding items, skills, or abilities to your character, changing the plot states, or teleporting to different locations. However, there are some things to keep in mind before using the codes:
  
- The codes have only been tested on the retail version of the game, not the Steam version. They may not work properly on other versions.
- You may not see the console or what you are typing on the screen. This is normal and does not mean that the codes are not working.
- The codes may have unintended consequences or cause glitches in the game. Use them at your own risk and make sure to save your game before using them.

Below is a list of some of the codes that you can use in the game and their effects. To use a code, type it exactly as it appears, including spaces and capitalization. Some codes require you to enter additional parameters, such as a number or a name, after the code. These parameters are indicated by brackets [ ]. Replace the brackets and their contents with the parameter that you want to use.
