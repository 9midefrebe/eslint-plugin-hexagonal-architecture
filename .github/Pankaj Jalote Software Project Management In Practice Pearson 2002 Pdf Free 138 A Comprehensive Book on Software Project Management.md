Software project management is a crucial skill for software engineers and managers who want to deliver high-quality software products on time and within budget. However, managing software projects is not an easy task, as it involves many challenges and uncertainties. How can software project managers plan, monitor, and control their projects effectively? What are the best practices and techniques for software project management?
 
One way to learn from the experience of successful software organizations is to read Software Project Management in Practice by Pankaj Jalote[^1^]. This book, published by Pearson Education India in 2002, provides a practical framework for software project management based on the author's extensive research and consulting work with Infosys Technologies, a leading software company in India. The book covers the key aspects of software project management, such as process planning, project estimation, risk management, project scheduling, project monitoring, quality assurance, change management, and project closure. The book also explains how these practices are compatible with the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), a widely adopted model for software process improvement.

The book is organized into nine chapters, each focusing on a specific topic of software project management. The book uses a running example of an actual software project from Infosys to illustrate the concepts and techniques discussed in each chapter. The book also includes several case studies, exercises, and appendices to help readers apply the knowledge gained from the book to their own projects. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with minimal jargon and technical details. The book is suitable for software engineers, managers, students, and researchers who want to learn more about software project management in practice.
 
Software Project Management in Practice by Pankaj Jalote is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to improve their software project management skills and deliver better software products. The book offers a comprehensive and practical guide to software project management based on the experience of a highly regarded high-maturity organization. The book is available as a free PDF download from the Internet Archive[^1^] or as an ebook from Google Books[^2^] [^3^].
  
In chapter one, the author introduces the concept of software project management and explains why it is important for software organizations. The author also describes the main characteristics of software projects, such as complexity, uncertainty, and changeability. The author then presents the software project management framework that is used throughout the book. The framework consists of four phases: process planning, project planning, project execution, and project closure. The author also discusses the role of the software project manager and the skills and responsibilities required for this role.
 
In chapter two, the author focuses on the process planning phase, which involves defining the software development process that will be followed for a project. The author explains how to select a suitable process model, such as waterfall, iterative, or agile, based on the project characteristics and requirements. The author also describes how to tailor and document the process model using process assets, such as standards, guidelines, templates, and tools. The author then illustrates how Infosys uses a customized version of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) as its standard process model for software projects.
 
In chapter three, the author covers the project planning phase, which involves estimating the size, effort, cost, and duration of a project. The author explains how to use various estimation techniques, such as analogy, expert judgment, algorithmic models, and function points. The author also discusses how to account for various factors that affect estimation accuracy, such as productivity, complexity, quality, and risk. The author then shows how Infosys uses a combination of function points and COCOMO II to estimate its software projects.
