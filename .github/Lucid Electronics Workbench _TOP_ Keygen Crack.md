Lucid Electronics Workbench has several features that make it easy and convenient to use. You can select from a variety of power supply types and enter the transformer voltage and power supply load. The program will then calculate the values for diodes, capacitors, output voltage and load current. You can also use the Ohm's Law calculator to find the values of resistance, power, current and voltage when any two of them are given.
 
Another feature of Lucid Electronics Workbench is the regulator circuit component values calculator. You can choose from a number of adjustable and fixed regulator types, and the program will display the case styles, pin outs, capacitor values and resistor values for the desired output voltage and supply voltage. You can also use the web links to regulator components provided by the program when available.
 
Lucid Electronics Workbench can also help you with transistor circuit component values. It can calculate the bias resistors, emitter and collector resistors, and the capacitor values for input, output and emitter bypass. It can also display actual component values as well as standard component values. You can view or print the output along with an applicable schematic.
 
One more feature of Lucid Electronics Workbench is the 555 timer component values calculator. You can use this feature to calculate the frequency and duty cycle based on C1, R1 and R2 values; or calculate C1 and R2 values based on frequency and R2 values; or calculate R1 and R2 values based on frequency, duty cycle and frequency tolerance values. The program can also show you actual component values as well as standard component values.
 
Lucid Electronics Workbench is a user-friendly and affordable software program that can save you time and money when designing electronic circuits. You can download a free evaluation copy from their website [https://www.lucidcc.com/LEWB.php](https://www.lucidcc.com/LEWB.php) or purchase a full version for $14.95. The program runs on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 operating systems.

In this article, we will show you some examples of how to use Lucid Electronics Workbench to design and calculate some common electronic circuits. We will also provide some screenshots of the program interface and the output results.
 
## Example 1: LED Load Resistor Calculator
 
One of the simplest and most common electronic circuits is the LED circuit. An LED (light emitting diode) is a device that emits light when a current passes through it. However, an LED cannot be directly connected to a power supply, because it will draw too much current and burn out. Therefore, a load resistor is needed to limit the current and protect the LED.
 
To calculate the value of the load resistor for an LED circuit, you can use the LED Load Resistor Calculator feature of Lucid Electronics Workbench. You just need to enter the supply voltage and select an LED product from the list. The program will then calculate the value of the load resistor and display it in ohms. It will also show you a table of standard resistor values so that you can choose the closest one for your circuit.
 
For example, suppose you want to connect a red LED to a 9V battery. You can enter 9 in the supply voltage box and select Red LED from the list. The program will then calculate that the load resistor value should be 470 ohms. It will also show you that the closest standard resistor value is 470 ohms as well. You can then view or print the output report, which includes a schematic diagram of the circuit.

## Example 2: Power Supply Component Values Calculator
 
Another common electronic circuit is the power supply circuit. A power supply is a device that converts an alternating current (AC) input voltage into a direct current (DC) output voltage. A power supply usually consists of four main components: a transformer, a rectifier, a filter capacitor and a regulator.
 
To calculate the values of these components for a power supply circuit, you can use the Power Supply Component Values Calculator feature of Lucid Electronics Workbench. You just need to select a power supply type and enter the transformer voltage and power supply load. The program will then calculate the values for diodes, capacitors, output voltage and load current.
 
For example, suppose you want to design a full-wave rectifier power supply with a center-tapped transformer that has an input voltage of 120V AC and an output voltage of 12V AC. You also want to have an output voltage of 5V DC and a load current of 1A. You can select Full Wave Rectifier from the list and enter 12 in the transformer voltage box and 1 in the power supply load box. The program will then calculate that you need four diodes with a peak inverse voltage (PIV) of at least 16.8V, a filter capacitor with a capacitance of at least 6600 microfarads and a voltage rating of at least 10V, and a fixed regulator with an output voltage of 5V and a current rating of at least 1A. You can then view or print the output report, which includes a schematic diagram of the circuit.
