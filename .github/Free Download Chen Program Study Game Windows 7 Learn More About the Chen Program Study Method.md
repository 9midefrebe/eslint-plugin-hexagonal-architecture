# How to Play Fable 3 Without a DVD on PC
 
Fable 3 is a role-playing game that lets you shape your own destiny as a hero or a tyrant in the land of Albion. You can explore a rich and vibrant world, interact with various characters, and make choices that affect the story and the gameplay. But what if you want to play Fable 3 on your PC without having to insert the DVD every time?
 
Fortunately, there is a way to do that. You can use a no-DVD crack that bypasses the disc check and lets you run the game from your hard drive. A no-DVD crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that removes the need for a physical disc. However, before you use a no-DVD crack, you should be aware of some risks and precautions.

First of all, using a no-DVD crack may violate the terms of service of the game and its publisher, Microsoft. You should only use a no-DVD crack if you own a legitimate copy of the game and you want to play it for personal use only. You should not distribute or share the no-DVD crack with anyone else, as that may constitute piracy and result in legal consequences.
 
Secondly, using a no-DVD crack may expose your PC to malware and viruses. You should only download a no-DVD crack from a trusted source, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^], and scan it with an antivirus program before running it. You should also backup your game files and your system before applying the no-DVD crack, in case something goes wrong.
 
Thirdly, using a no-DVD crack may affect the performance and stability of the game. You may encounter bugs, glitches, crashes, or compatibility issues with the no-DVD crack. You may also lose access to some features of the game, such as online multiplayer, achievements, or updates. You should always keep your original game disc handy, in case you need to restore or reinstall the game.
 
If you are still interested in using a no-DVD crack for Fable 3 on PC, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Insert your Fable 3 DVD into your PC and install the game normally.
2. Go to GameCopyWorld[^1^] and search for "Fable 3".
3. Select the appropriate no-DVD crack for your version of the game. For example, if you have Fable 3 v1.1.0.3, you should download Fable 3 v1.1.0.3 +16 TRAINER.
4. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your PC.
5. Copy the Fable3.exe file from the folder to your game installation directory, usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Fable III.
6. Replace the original Fable3.exe file with the cracked one.
7. Run the game from the cracked Fable3.exe file or create a shortcut to it on your desktop.
8. Enjoy playing Fable 3 without a DVD on PC!

The trail is especially handy when you are in a hurry or lost, but you should not rely on it too much. Sometimes, it is more fun and rewarding to wander off the beaten path and discover new places and secrets. You might find hidden chests, dive spots, keys, gnomes, flowers, books, and more. So don't be afraid to explore and experiment with different routes.
 
## Start Buying Up All The Property
 
One of the main goals of Fable 3 is to become the king or queen of Albion and save it from a terrible threat. To do that, you will need a lot of money. The best way to earn money in this game is to buy and rent out properties. The more properties you own, the more income you will receive every five minutes.
 
You should start buying properties as soon as possible, even if they are cheap and shabby. You can always upgrade them later by repairing them and raising their rent. You should also focus on buying shops and stalls, as they don't require maintenance and they generate more income than houses. You can buy properties by interacting with their signs or by using the map in the Sanctuary.
 
Buying properties is not only good for your wallet, but also for your reputation. Depending on how you set your rent and prices, you can increase or decrease your morality and popularity. If you want to be a good and loved ruler, you should lower your rent and prices to make people happy. If you want to be an evil and feared ruler, you should raise your rent and prices to make people miserable.
 
## Search For Hidden Dive Spots
 
Another way to find treasures and secrets in Fable 3 is to look for dive spots. These are hidden locations in rivers and lakes where you can dive underwater and access new areas. You can find dive spots by exploring the edges of water bodies or by following your dog's barks.
 
Dive spots can lead you to caves, tunnels, islands, chests, keys, gnomes, flowers, books, and more. Some dive spots are part of quests or achievements, while others are optional. Some dive spots are easy to spot, while others are well hidden. You should always keep an eye out for bubbles on the water surface or ripples on the shore.
 
Diving is not only useful for finding loot, but also for escaping enemies or avoiding obstacles. You can dive by pressing A near a dive spot or by holding B while swimming. You can stay underwater for as long as you want without drowning. You can also swim faster by holding RT while moving.
