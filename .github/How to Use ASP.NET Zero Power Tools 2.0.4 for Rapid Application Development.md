## How to Use ASP.NET Zero Power Tools
 
To use ASP.NET Zero Power Tools, you need to have Visual Studio 2017 (v15.9.0+) or Visual Studio 2022 (amd64) installed on your Windows machine. You also need to have .NET Core 2.2 Runtime and EF Core Tools installed.
 
After installing ASP.NET Zero Power Tools from the Visual Studio Marketplace or from Visual Studio's Extension and Updates menu, you can open your ASP.NET Zero solution in Visual Studio and right-click on the solution node in the Solution Explorer. You will see a menu item called "ASP.NET Zero Power Tools".
 
When you click on this menu item, you will see a dialog box where you can define your entity and its properties. You can also choose the project and the folder where you want to generate the code. You can also specify some options for the code generation, such as the DbContext type, the connection string name, the UI template, and the UI options.
 
After clicking on the "Generate" button, ASP.NET Zero Power Tools will create all the necessary files and folders for your entity in your solution. It will also run EF Core Tools to create a migration and update the database schema. You can then build and run your solution to see your CRUD page in action.
 
## How to Customize ASP.NET Zero Power Tools
 
ASP.NET Zero Power Tools allows you to customize the generated code using templates and options. You can find the templates and options in the "AspNetZeroRadTool" folder in your solution root folder.
 
The templates are Razor files that define the structure and content of the generated code. You can edit these files using Visual Studio or any text editor. You can use Razor syntax and some predefined variables to customize the code generation.
 
The options are JSON files that define some parameters for the code generation. You can edit these files using Visual Studio or any text editor. You can use these options to change some aspects of the generated code, such as the namespace, the base class, the permissions, and the UI elements.
 
You can also create your own templates and options and save them in a different folder. You can then select this folder in the Power Tools dialog box when generating code.
