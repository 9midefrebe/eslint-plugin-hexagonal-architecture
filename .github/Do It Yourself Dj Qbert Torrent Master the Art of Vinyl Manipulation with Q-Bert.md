`- Torrents are illegal and unethical. By downloading torrents, you are violating the intellectual property rights of DJ Qbert and his collaborators. You are also depriving them of the revenue they deserve for their hard work and creativity. This can hurt their ability to produce more quality content for their fans and students.
`
`- Torrents are unsafe and unreliable. Torrent files can contain viruses, malware, spyware, or other harmful programs that can damage your computer or steal your personal information. You also have no guarantee that the files you download are complete, accurate, or authentic. You might end up with corrupted, outdated, or fake files that do not match what you expected.
`
`- Torrents are ineffective and inefficient. Torrent downloads depend on the availability and speed of other users who are sharing the same files. This means that you might experience slow, interrupted, or failed downloads. You also have to deal with complicated software, settings, and protocols that can be confusing and frustrating. You might waste a lot of time and energy trying to get the files you want.
